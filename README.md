## Overview
You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). 
Your project has been divided into four parts where you'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on your insights.


This repository contains the following related projects:
* Part I: Dimensionality reduction using t-SNE algorithm
* Part II: Feature Selection
* Part III: Association Rules
* Part IV: Anomaly Detection

## Data Sources
* The first two parts use the same Supermarket dataset which can be gotten [here](http://bit.ly/CarreFourDataset)

* Part III uses data gotten from this [link](http://SupermarketDatasetII)

* Part IV uses data gotten from this [link](http://CarreFourSalesDataset)

## Objectives per Section
**Part I**
This section of the project entails reducing your dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA. You will be required to perform your analysis and provide insights gained from your analysis.

**Part II**
This section requires you to perform feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods learned earlier this week. You will be required to perform your analysis and provide insights on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset.

**Part III**
This section will require that you create association rules that will allow you to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. You are provided with a separate dataset that comprises groups of items that will be associated with others. Just like in the other sections, you will also be required to provide insights for your analysis.

**Part IV**
You have also been requested to check whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset. The objective of this task being fraud detection.
