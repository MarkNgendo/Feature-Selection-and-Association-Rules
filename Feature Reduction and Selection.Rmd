## Exploaratory Data Analysis

### Univariate Analysis

```{r}
# creating a mode function
mode <- function(x){
  uniqx <- unique(x)
  uniqx[which.max(tabulate(match(x, uniqx)))]
}
```

#### Branch

```{r}

# Visualization
ggplot(df, aes(Branch)) +
  geom_bar(stat="count") +
  labs(title="Branches Distribution") +
  theme_classic()
```

Branch distribution is roughly equal

#### Gender
```{r}
# Visualization
ggplot(df, aes(Gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat="count")
```


The gender distribution in the dataset is balanced.

#### Customer type
```{r}
# visualization
ggplot(df, aes(Customer.type)) +
  geom_bar()
```

The customer types were balanced in terms of distribution.

#### Product Line
```{r}
# visualization
ggplot(df, aes(Product.line)) +
  geom_bar()
```
 Fashion Accessories and, Food and Beverage tie for the most bought categories but the distribution does
 not suggest an imbalance in general.
 
#### Unit Price
```{r}

There is a fair distribution in the payment variable. However, fewer people tend to pay by Credit Card in these stores

### Bivariate Analysis

```{r product line vs Total Price}
ggplot(df, aes(x=Product.line, y=Total)) +
  geom_point()
```

Fashion Accessories have the highest Total prices while health and beauty products have a relatively lower price.

```{r Gendered Expenses}
ggplot(df ,aes(Gender, Total)) +
  geom_point()
```

Total Price is equally distributed in terms of gender

```{r Payment vs Total Price}
ggplot(df, aes(Payment, Total)) +
  geom_point()
```

The payment methods are nearly identical for the total prices of items at checkouts with some more expensive ones being attributed with Credit card payments.

```{r Gross Income vs Total}
ggplot(df, aes(gross.income, Total)) +
  geom_point()
```

As expected, there is a perfect positive linear relationship with how much the total is at checkout with the consumers gross income. 

```{r Customer type vs Total}
ggplot(df, aes(Customer.type , Total)) +
  geom_point()
```

Members and non members have a nearly equal distribution in expenditure with Members having no visible breaks in prices.

```{r Tax vs Total}
ggplot(df, aes(Tax, Total)) +
  geom_point()
```

There is a direct linear relationship between tax and total price. As expected, the higher the tax on items, the more they cost.

```{r Unit Price vs Total}
ggplot(df, aes(Unit.price, Total)) +
  geom_point()
```

There are several positive linear relationships with the Unit Price variable: the higher it is the higher the total price is. More data would be needed to explain the different lines considering they represent outside factors that influence the relationship. A good example would be the type of products being of different types.





```{r correlation table}

cor(df[,unlist(lapply(df, is.numeric))])
```
The following variables show strong correlation:

* Unit Price to Tax and COGS
* Quantity to Tax and COGS
* Gross Income to Unit Price, Quantity, Tax, COGS, Total


```{r copy of the dataset}
copy <- df[, -c(8, 9, 12, 15)]
label <- df[, 15]
```


## APPLICATION OF t-SNE ALGORITHM

```{r Label Encoding categorical columns}
branch <- LabelEncoder.fit(copy$Branch)
copy$Branch <- transform(branch, factor(df$Branch))

gender <- LabelEncoder.fit(copy$Gender)
copy$Gender <- transform(gender, factor(df$Gender))

customer <- LabelEncoder.fit(copy$Customer.type)
copy$Customer.type <- transform(customer, factor(copy$Customer.type))

product <- LabelEncoder.fit(copy$Product.line)
copy$Product.line <- transform(product, factor(copy$Product.line))

pay <- LabelEncoder.fit(copy$Payment)
copy$Payment <- transform(pay, factor(copy$Payment))

```

```{r building the model}
model <- Rtsne(copy, dims=2, perplexity=30, verbose= TRUE, max_iter=1000)
summary(model)
```
```{r viewing output}
head(model$Y)
```

```{r visualizing results}

plot(model$Y, t='p', main="Output of TSNE")
```


## Feature Selection

```{r correlation method}
corrMat <- cor(copy)

# highly correlated features
high <- findCorrelation(corrMat, cutoff = .75)

# names of highly correlated features

names(copy[, high])
```


```{r comparison after dropping high}
# data set without highly correlated variables
c2 <- copy[-high]

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

# plotting
corrplot(corrMat, order = "hclust")
corrplot(cor(c2), order = "hclust")
```



```{r Feature Ranking method}
# adding Ratings column to copy data set

copy$Rating <- df$Rating

# how different variable score in relation to rating variable

scores <- information.gain(Rating~., copy)
subset <- cutoff.k(scores, 5)

# Needed features (5)
as.data.frame(subset)
```

## Conclusions


From the above analysis,  the following variables have been found to be highly correlated:

* Tax
* Cost of Goods
* Gross Income


Using a Feature Ranking method with Information Gain of all variables being used as a metric of comparison, 
the following five variables would be the best to use for modeling a regressor with respect to Rating:

* Branch
* Customer Type
* Gender
* Product Line
* Unit Price

## Recommendations
The following are my recommendations based on the above analysis:

* The marketing department should focus on the Electronics, Health and Beauty and Lifestyle departments in terms of promotions seeing as the data says that these areas are the smaller contributors.

* To offer some added benefits that come with being a member seeing as the analysis shows that members are distributed at all price points whereas non members have some minute gap. This would help to motivate more people to become members and hopefully increase the sales.

To use the identified features in the conclusions segment if they want to build a regression model to predict the sales. These features have been curated extensively and can yield better results than the entire roster of variables provided.
